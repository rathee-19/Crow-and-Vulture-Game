# Crow and Vulture Game

## Overview

This project is an interactive turtle graphics game implemented in Python. The game involves crows and a vulture, with specific rules for their movement and interaction. It uses the turtle graphics library to create the game environment and handle user interactions.

## Project Details

- **Course Name**: DASS (Data Structures and Algorithms)
- **Assignment**: This project was done as an assignment in the DASS course.

## Directory Structure

The repository contains the following directories:

1. **Original**: Contains the original code before any modifications.
2. **Pylint_codes**: Contains the code modified through several iterations to improve the Pylint score. 
3. **Lint_scores_Kaooa**: Contains the Pylint scores and suggestions for each iteration.

## Iterative Improvements

The code was iteratively improved to achieve a better Pylint score. Here are the results of the iterations:

- Initial score: `0.00/10`
- After first iteration: `0.55/10`
- After second iteration: `3.21/10`
- After third iteration: `3.74/10`
- After fourth iteration: `4.24/10`
- After fifth iteration: `9.20/10`
- Final score: `9.35/10`

## Setup and Running

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Turtle**: The turtle module is included with Python's standard library, so no additional installation is necessary.

3. **Run the Game**: Save the provided code into a `.py` file and execute it using a Python interpreter. The game will open in a turtle graphics window where you can interact with the crows and vulture according to the game rules.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple game using Python's turtle graphics library. The code was progressively improved to enhance its quality and achieve a high Pylint score. It serves as an assignment submission for the DASS course.
